                    <td>Use Join to map all the stages of your work process. When looking at the board, you should be able to understand how work is processed. Start with a basic board structure and split it into a few primary sections that show different work stages.</td>

                    <td>Is a perfect tool for visualizing potential problems in your process. The logic is simple: if you see a column in which tasks arrive faster than they leave, work will start to pile up, and the problem will become visible to the whole team. This may be caused by a temporary issue or a bottleneck in your process. </td>
